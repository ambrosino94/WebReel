# Netflix n' Code

###### Development Project Report.



#### `Description`

For this final project we coded a Cage Elephant Clicker ( it's a band), this code is based on a game called Cookie Clicker, but the challenge was to do it based on our own learning and knowledge that we acquired in class, and with some research, we were able to code this clicker. 

How does this game work? Well every time you click the band you will notice the counter goes up, the more you click the more Cage elephants you will get, when you reach the necessary amount of cage elephants you will be able to purchase and item, the items are albums and after you purchase the album, you will see the upgrades, the upgrades are songs from the albums, and that's practically how the game works.

These are the features of this project:

```
Backgroung with 3 colums.
Main clicker designed with a class, that incrments the gamer's currency.
An indicator the amount of currency you have.
This game has 3 items, Cookie clicker, Txts and ItemBtn, they all are designed as classes.
One upgrade buttom per item (5 items= 5 upgrades).
Has 2 extra animations in th middle that are related to the band.
5 item buttons (Social Cues, Unpeeled, Tell Me, Melophobia , Skin and bones).
5 upgrades(Cold, Telescope, Broken, Spider, Rubber).
```

```
Extras:
Has 2 extra images in the middle that are related to the band.
