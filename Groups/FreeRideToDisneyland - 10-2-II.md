# Free ride to Disneyland!

###### Development Project Report.



#### `Description`

This project is based on a game in which you gain cookies every time you click the cookie. By using those cookies as currency, you are able to buy objects. These objects help produce more cookies automatically. There are also upgrades which will change the way the game behaves. Depending on what the object or upgrade states, it will help you gain even more cookies (or lose them perhaps), making it possible to keep buying more objects and upgrades. In that way, you may accumulate even more delicious cookie currency. 

These are the features of this project:

```
The background is divided into three functions.
The main button is clickable. It increments your currency and has animation (+1).
An indicator in the canvas shows the amount of currency you own in the game.
There are 3 items that can be bought in the game. These allow certain automatic currency production.
There is an upgrade button per item which will change the way the game behaves by altering variables.
```

```
Extras:
BONUS- The upgrades are designed using classes
BONUS- Animations for item production and extra designs
BONUS- 3 extra items and 3 extra upgrades
```
