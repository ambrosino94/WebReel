# Netflix n' Code

###### Development Project Report.



#### `Description`

This code is based on the Cookie Clicker game, but with a twist. We decided to change the cookie theme to a popcorn/Netflix theme. We added a TV screen to the middle section for it to look like if you were watching the Netflix series. On the left side, we put a bucket of popcorns which is often eaten at the movies (actually, it is the most famous snack to eat in movie theatres) and at the other side we have accomplished to put some of our favorite shows in Netflix, such as Anne with an E, Supergirl, GLEE, Stranger Things and Money Heist. To watch the episodes of each series, you need to get the required amount of popcorns written in the boxes at the right.

These are the features of this project:

```
Background layout is divided into three sections and colored with the distinctive colors of Netflix. 
Popcorn-shaped button that when clicked, your currency (in this case popcorns) increases.
An indicator at the top left corner that shows you the amount of popcorns youâ€™ve collected.
Five different items named as some of our favorite Netflix series.
One upgrade boton per item which is only available once you have bought at least one item.
```

```
Extras:
Upgrades are designed as classes.
Two extra items.
Items button lights up once you have enough popcorns to purchase the item.
Upgrade button lights up once you have enough popcorns to purchase it and at least one item purchased.
Rotating star behind the popcorn-shaped boton.
A TV that changes its screen once you purchase a new item/series. (It changes to the picture of the last bought series).
Some little circles decorating both sides of the middle section.
Extra decorative and informative text.
