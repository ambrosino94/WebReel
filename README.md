# Final Project WebReel

This platform is dedicated to my former students showcasing the outstanding final projects developed by them 10th graders. The objective of the project was to create a cookie clicker-style game using object-oriented programming `OOP` with either `Processing.js` or `p5.js`. The students had the freedom to design their games based on their own ideas and preferences.

## About the Website

The Final Project Showcase website is a collaborative effort between myself and two other colleagues. Our aim was to create a seamless integration of each student's project within the website using `JavaScript`, the core language they were learning. The website features the following:

- Project Integration: Each selected project is integrated naturally within the website, allowing visitors to experience the games directly on the webpage. The use of `JavaScript` ensures that the projects can be seamlessly deployed within the website.

- Project Descriptions: For each showcased project, a brief explanation is provided using Markdown, describing the game concept and highlighting the key features implemented by the student group. This provides visitors with insights into the thought process and creativity behind each project.

- Visual Presentation: The website offers an appealing visual presentation, with dedicated sections for each project. An embedded version of their games are included to give visitors a glimpse of the game's aesthetics and mechanics.

## Deployment

The Final Project Showcase website is hosted on `Netlify` and deployed using `GitHub`. This combination of technologies ensures reliable hosting and effortless updates, allowing visitors to explore the projects smoothly and stay informed about the latest additions.

Thank you for visiting the Final Project WebReel and appreciating the hard work and creativity of my talented programming students!
